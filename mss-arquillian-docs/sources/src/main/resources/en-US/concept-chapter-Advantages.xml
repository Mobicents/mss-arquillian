	<title>Advantages of the Mobicents Sip Servlets Arquillian Framework
	</title>
	<para>One of the most important advantage of the framework is the clear
		and concise model the framework provides.</para>
	<para>The framework's main two parts, are individual and can be
		replaced by an equivalent module if needed, the sip client for example
		can be replaced with a user provided sip client. Also, later there will
		be containers for the framework based on Tomcat 7.x and JBoss AS 7
		that could be used instead of the Tomcat 6.x container.</para>

	<para>The fact that the framework is based on Arquillian is also a big
		advantage of the solution. Users can make use of the Arquillian
		extensions, or use Arquillian SPI to provide their own extension
	</para>
