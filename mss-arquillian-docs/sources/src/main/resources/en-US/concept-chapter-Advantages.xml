		and concise model the framework provides.</para>
	<para>The framework's main two parts, are individual and can be
		replaced by an equivalent module if needed, the sip client for example
		can be replaced with a user provided sip client.</para>

	<para>Extensibility is a major advantage also. Since the framework is based on Arquillian users can take advantages of the Arquillian
		extensions, or use Arquillian SPI to provide their own extension.
